All the bits and pieces for turning the input table(s) into a transition rates time series then into a forecast

Probably with a class for keeping track of everything and making the necessary

Could be split out into subcomponents as Tambe suggested: Transitions

Somewhere we'll have to have a structure to hold hypothetical 'adjustments' added in frontend.

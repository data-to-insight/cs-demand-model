# Demand Modelling Documentation

We have a number of Jupyter notebooks walking through the code and calculation steps. 

These files include sample data - this is all synthentic data and does not represent real individuals, nor is it as varied as real data.

* [Configuration](./configuration.ipynb) - How to configure the tool
* [File Loader](./file-loader.ipynb) - How to load files into the tool
* [Data Container](./data-container.ipynb) - How we enrich and access the data from the model
* [Data Analysis](./data-analysis.ipynb) - The key calculations required by the predictive model
